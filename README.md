## ‚û§ Description <a name="#-description"></a>

This repository contains a containerized setup of the xmrig tool, which allows you to go from zero to mining in about 5 minutes on any architecture running containers.

CPU mining can be profitable using algorithms such as: `RandomX`, `Cryptonight` or `Equihash`. Learn more about profitability [here](https://www.nicehash.com/profitability-calculator).

## ‚û§ Getting Started <a name="#-getting-started"></a>

### Setup

To configure your system for the development of this project, follow the steps below:

- Install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to manage runtime dependencies.
- Install runtime dependencies.

```bash
cut -d' ' -f1 .tool-versions | xargs -I{} sh -c 'asdf plugin add "$1"' -- {}
asdf install
```

- Run task from the root of the repository to see available commands. We use task in place of make for this project. See [Taskfile.yml](Taskfile.yml) for more information.

### Variables

The preferred way to configure XMRig is using a configuration file in JSON format, because it is more flexible and easier to use. The CLI doesn't cover all the features available and can be a limiting factor, depending on the scenario.

| Name                  | Description                   |
|-------------------    |-----------------------------  |
| MINING_POOL           | URL of mining server          |
| MINING_COIN           | Coin to mining                |
| REFERRAL_CODE         | Param to educe mining rater   |
| WALLET_ADDRESS        | Wallet address                |
| WORKER_NAME           | Worker name                   |
| XMRIG_CONFIG_FILE     | XMRig config file reference   |

### Running

**Docker**

## ‚û§ Concepts

This section aims to describe at a high level which tools we use and how we use them, without reproducing documentation that is better written (and more up-to-date) in the repositories and websites of the tools themselves. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with these tools as soon as possible.

### XMRig

Basically, XMRig is a free, open-source mining program. It can be installed on Windows, Linux and macOS, and allows you to mine using the RandomX algorithm. Here's a brief example of the run command:

```bash
xmrig.exe -o rx.unmineable.com:3333 -a rx -k -u COIN:YOUR_ADDRESS.WORKER_NAME#REFERRAL_CODE -p x pause
```

- **COIN**: it's the coin that you're extracting, for example: **ADA**, **TRX**, **WIN** or more. Also, keep the `:` symbol between the currency and your address.
- **YOUR_ADDRESS**: must be a valid address for the currency you choose, otherwise the pool will return an error, also be sure to check the supported network for some currencies like TRC20 for USDT mining (TRON address).
- **WORKER_NAME**: it's any name that you would like to define for your worker.
- **REFERRAL_CODE**: it's the parameter used to reduce the mining rate.

### Unmineable

Unmineable is a mining pool that allows anyone to become a miner using a personal computer.

### ASIC

The acronym ASIC describes a series of computer devices designed from start to finish to provide maximum performance in cryptocurrency mining tasks.

### RandomX

RandomX is a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm that is optimized for general-purpose CPUs. RandomX uses random code execution (hence the name) along with various hard memory techniques to minimize the efficiency advantage of specialized hardware.

### Mining Rig

A mining rig is a mining platform. The rig can be a dedicated miner, where it has been bought, built and operated specifically for mining, or it can be a computer that fulfills other needs, such as a gaming system, and is used to mine only part-time.

### CPU Limit

Cpulimit is a tool that allows us to limit CPU usage by process. It gives us a few ways to identify the desired process, either by process name, PID or executable path. It's useful for controlling batch tasks when you don't want them to consume too many CPU cycles. The aim is to prevent a process from running for more than a certain amount of time. It is also able to adapt to the overall system load dynamically and quickly.

### Security

<div align="center">

<img alt="gif-about" src=".github/assets/security.jpg" width="375"/>

</div>

Pay attention to the images you use for these purposes and protect yourself against cryptojacking. Containers have become frequent targets for threat actors carrying out malicious cryptocurrency mining and other attacks. Last year, Trend Micro came across activities by cryptocurrency miners that were implemented as rogue containers using a community-distributed image published on Docker Hub. In May, researchers found an open directory that contained a malicious cryptocurrency miner and a distributed denial of service (DDoS) bot that targeted open Docker daemon ports. In the attack, an Alpine Linux container was created to host the cryptocurrency miner and the DDoS bot.
